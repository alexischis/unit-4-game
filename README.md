# unit-4-game

This is a guessing game where the user is asked to match the computer's random value.
To do this, the user can choose between four crystals that each have been assigned a value. 
The crystal's value will be added to the total score at the bottom.
The user will contine to click the crystals until the total score matches the given random value.
If the total score matches the random value it is considered a win.
An alert will appear congratulating the user.
However, if the total score is over the random value it is considered a loss. 
An alert will appear letting the user know their guess was too much.
The game automatically resets after a win or loss; a new random value is chosen, the crystals will have different values and the total score wil equal 0 until a crystal is clicked.

- Each crystal can have a random value between 1-12.
- The computer's random guess can be any value between 19-120.
- The values of the crystals are not listed, the user will have to use basic math to guess the value of each crystal after they are clicked.
- The user does not have to use every crystal to match the random value.
